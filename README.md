# "Hacking is not a destination, it is a journey"  -take that journey and never look back.

Here i have a collection of books to get you started on hacking.
Its important to keep reading while persuming hacking.

# 1. Web application Hacker's handbook:-
              Reading this book will give you a clear idea of how things generally work in the web(web application).
              Start with readnig this book and practice implementing the things you've learnt in some vulnerable web
              application(dvwa,metasploit,owasp,..etc). Once you've done that jump into bug bounty start with bugcrowd 
              and hackerone although i recommendre the later one. Read POC(Proof-Of-Concept) from the disclosed reports.
              Pickup things on the go and whatever you've leart implement it, reading theory gives a false sense of believe 
              about the concept and only implementing the idea lasts forever in your memory.
